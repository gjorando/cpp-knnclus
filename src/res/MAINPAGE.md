# C++ kNNclus module

### A clustering procedure using the kNN algorithm for general purposes

This module is an implementation of a clustering procedure based on the K-nearest neighbor rule. It is very similar to the EkNNclus algorithm, as described in "EK-NNclus: a clustering procedure based on the evidential K-nearest neighbor rule" by Thierry Denoeux, Orakanya Kanjanatarakul, and Songsak Sriboonchitta.
